# PhD Study Code Repository

This repository provides information on accessing the Python and R scripts used in my PhD study. The source code for these scripts is hosted on GitHub, an online code repository platform.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. `Data_Analysis`: Contains scripts used for analyzing the data collected during the study. This folder also contains all the raw data used for the analysis.

2. `Data_Extraction`: Contains scripts used for extracting data from the various sources used in the study. This folder also contains all the raw data that was extracted.

3. `Input_Data`: Contains the input data that the scripts in this repository work with. This folder contains all the raw input data used by the scripts.

4. `Output_Data`: Contains the data generated as output by the scripts in this repository. This includes both the processed data and the raw output data.

5. `Pre-Data`: Contains pre-processed data that is ready for analysis. This folder also contains the raw data that was pre-processed.

In addition to these directories, the repository also contains the following files:

- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the repository and information on how to use the scripts.

- `Reference.pdf`: A reference document providing additional information relevant to the study.

## Usage

To use the scripts in this repository, first, clone the repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the appropriate directory for the task you're interested in (e.g., data extraction, data analysis), and run the scripts following the instructions provided in the README files within each directory.

## Contributing
